# TamateBako

**This product has been developed in [ETHGlobal Brussels](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels)**

TamateBako is an innovative NFT platform that brings excitement and mystery to the NFT purchasing experience. The name "Tamatebako" is inspired by a legendary Japanese folk tale about Urashima Tarō and the mysterious "Tamatebako" or "Treasure Box" he receives. This box, when opened, is said to reveal unexpected wonders, symbolizing surprise and discovery. In Japanese culture, the phrase "開けてびっくり玉手箱" (akete bikkuri tamatebako) translates to "open and be surprised by the treasure box," capturing the essence of unexpected joy and intrigue.

Our app ensures that users never know what unique NFT they will receive until the moment of purchase. This element of surprise adds an engaging, lottery-like thrill to each transaction, making NFT collection both fun and captivating.

## Features

- **Fair Distribution**: Each NFT is randomly assigned to ensure fair and equal chances for all users to obtain rare and valuable items.
- **Data Privacy Control**: All data related to NFTs are encrypted, and NFT holders have control over whether to keep their data private or make it public.
